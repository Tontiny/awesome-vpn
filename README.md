#### [Open Source Clients](https://github.com/awesome-vpn/awesome-vpn/wiki/Clients)

Currently, all one-click VPN clients face various issues:

- Connection failures. Server domains or IPs are blocked.
- Unavailable in app stores, blocked by official markets. Popular apps, once blocked, are often impersonated by fake ones.
- Forced payment. Or only a few days of free trial. Or limited traffic.

I am researching long-standing VPN clients in various app markets, aiming to use this experience as a foundation to develop a free, permanent, cross-platform app that can be used long-term.

We welcome experienced developers to discuss in Issues and Discussions.
